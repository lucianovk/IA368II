# Vacuum Cleaner Robot Simulation (CoppeliaSim + Python) 

![Spiral Coverage](lvk_navigation.png)

This repository contains three Python scripts for simulating a **vacuum cleaner robot** in **CoppeliaSim**.  
All scripts support **manual or autonomous navigation** patterns commonly found in household robots and include odometry-based updates.

1. **Goal-based navigation with reactive obstacle avoidance** — [Read more](sim-1-goal-based-navigation.md)
2. **Pure reactive obstacle avoidance** (randomized turns) — [Read more](sim-2-obstacle-avoidance.md)
3. **Systematic area coverage using spiral waypoints** — [Read more](sim-3-spiral-coverage.md)
